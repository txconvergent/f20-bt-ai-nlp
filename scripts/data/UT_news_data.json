And the university’s first-year undergraduate retention rate climbed to a record high of 96.7%, up 1.0% from last fall. “This success reflects the hard work of our outstanding students, who come to Austin from a diverse range of backgrounds but are united in their ability to thrive and excel once they get here,” said interim President Jay Hartzell. “ ”Graduation rates at UT have shown consistent improvement since 2011, when the university set a goal of increasing the four-year graduation rate from 52% to 70%.",

Research led by The University of Texas at Austin is adding some clarity on weather’s role in COVID-19 infection, with a new study finding that temperature and humidity do not play a significant role in coronavirus spread. Across scales, the scientists found that the weather had nearly no influence. “We shouldn’t think of the problem as something driven by weather and climate,” Jamshidi said. “",
